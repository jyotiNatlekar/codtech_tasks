DOMAIN : PYTHON PROGRAMMING

DURATION : 4 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

This project is part of the **CODTECH Python & Machine Learning Internship – Task 4**. The main objective of this task is to build a **predictive machine learning model** using **Scikit-learn**. The chosen application for this task is **SMS Spam Detection**, which is a classic and widely used text classification problem.

Spam detection plays an important role in real life because people often receive unwanted or harmful messages such as promotional ads, phishing messages, and fraud alerts. This project helped me understand how machine learning can automatically classify such messages and reduce manual effort.

In this project, an SMS dataset is processed, cleaned, and converted into numerical form using **TF-IDF vectorization**. A **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model is then trained to classify messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. This project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline including **data loading, preprocessing, vectorization, model training, evaluation, and prediction**. Although the project is simple, it is very practical and commonly used in real-world applications.

Project Workflow (Important Steps)

1.Dataset Loading
SMS dataset loaded (spam / ham)

2.Data Preprocessing
Labels converted to numeric values
     ham = 0
     spam = 1

3.Train-Test Split
    80% training data
    20% testing data

4.Text Vectorization
TF-IDF used to convert text into numbers

5.Model Training
Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm used

6.Model Evaluation
Accuracy achieved: ~97.8%

7.Prediction
Model predicts whether a message is SPAM or NOT SPAM

Applications
