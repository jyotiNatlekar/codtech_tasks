AI CHATBOT WITH NLP

COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME : JYOTI VIJAY NATLEKAR

INTERN ID : CT04DR2389

DOMAIN : PYTHON PROGRAMMING

DURATION : 4 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH


This project was developed as part of my internship to understand how **Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** can be used to build an interactive chatbot. The main goal of this project was to create an **AI-powered chatbot** that can understand user queries and provide meaningful responses automatically.

The chatbot is designed to simulate human-like conversation. It takes user input, processes the text, identifies the intent, and generates an appropriate response. This project demonstrates how Python can be used to build intelligent systems that interact with users in real time. The chatbot can be used for answering common questions, providing information, and assisting users without human intervention.


## Tools & Technologies Used 

* **Python 3**
* **NLTK / Scikit-learn** (for text processing and intent matching)
* **Flask** (for web-based chatbot interface)
* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (for frontend chat UI)

## Installation (Basic)

```bash
pip install flask nltk scikit-learn


## Project Workflow (Simple Steps)

1. **User Input**

   * User types a message in the chatbot interface

2. **Text Preprocessing**

   * Input text is cleaned and tokenized

3. **Intent Recognition**

   * The chatbot matches the user query with predefined intents or trained data

4. **Response Generation**

   * A suitable response is selected and returned to the user

5. **Display Output**

   * The response is shown instantly in the chat interface

## Features Implemented

* Interactive chat interface
* Automatic response generation
* Handles multiple user queries
* Simple and user-friendly design

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how AI chatbots work in real-world applications. I gained practical experience in **text preprocessing**, **basic NLP concepts**, and **building conversational logic**. I also learned how backend logic connects with a frontend interface to create a complete working application.

This project helped me understand how chatbots are used in customer support systems, virtual assistants, and information services. It improved my confidence in Python programming and AI-based application development.

## Applications

* Customer Support Chatbots
* College or Company Helpdesk Systems
* FAQ Assistants
* Virtual Assistants

## Conclusion

The AI Chatbot project demonstrates the practical use of Python and AI concepts to build an intelligent conversational system. It is simple, beginner-friendly, and useful for real-world automation. This project strengthened my understanding of AI, NLP, and full project development from scratch.
